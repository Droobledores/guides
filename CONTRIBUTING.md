## How to contribute to guides.rubygems.org

#### If you want to contribute to RubyGems itself, visit [the RubyGems Guides](http://guides.rubygems.org/contributing/)
This guide just covers the details of contributing to the guides themselves.

### Setting up a local development environment

The guides are built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). To run the site locally, you'll first need to install Jekyll via `gem install jekyll`. Once installed, you can start the development server via `jekyll server` and point your browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

### Things you can't update here!

Most of the site can be modified directly in this repository. However, the files below are generated from the [RubyGems source](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems). Any changes to them need to be updated there and will get applied here when the next RubyGems version is released.

* command-reference.md
* specification-reference.md
